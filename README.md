Project #2 - Family Feud
Video Link - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXcYgZP7z_Q
Language:  Java, C++, Python
Note: this version of the game will play slightly differently than the TV show. 

Requirements
The game should have a menu of functions
Option 1 - Instructions
Option 2 - Play game
The game will prompt for the name of both teams
Team #1 will be shown the total number of correct answers and receive the first question
The user (representing the whole team) will give an answer to the question
If correct, the user will be 
notified of the correct answer
Be shown the “board” 
Prompted to provide another answer
If incorrect, 
the user will be informed the answer is incorrect
The user will be shown the number of incorrect answers to that question so far
If this is the first or second incorrect answer
Be asked to provide another answer
If this is the third incorrect answer
Team #2 will have an opportunity to guess one of the remaining answers
If they guess correctly they win that round and get the total number of points on “the board”
If they guess incorrectly, team #1 will win the round and get the total number of points on “the board”
For the next round, the opposite team will go first
After two questions 
the score should be displayed
The user should be asked if they want to play another round
If yes, repeat above steps
If not, display the final score, the winner and go back to the start menu
Option 3 - Add New Cards
The user should be able to add the questions, answers, points and any other relevant data to the application.  
The game should confirm the user’s input has been added and show the last 3 cards that have been added to the system
Total points for a question is 100
There are usually four to eight answers per question
There should be at least 10 questions saved that are randomly presented to the user
There should never be the same question in one “game”

Considerations
What did you do to make sure that the answers that users enter match what is saved? (i.e. typos, case sensitivity, synonyms, etc.)
How is the question and answer data being stored? What data structure is used? Why was that ADT chosen compared to other ADTs? Assume that the number of cards can be a very large number.
